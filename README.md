# react-copy-code

react-copy-code is a component that will add a "copy to clipboard" button to 'pre code' blocks that are rendered as it's children. Children can be jsx, other components, or an html string by setting the `innerHtml` prop. If the `highlight` prop is set, it also uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to add the proper classes needed for highlighting code.

## Installation

`npm install react-copy-code`

## Usage

```
import CodeBlock from 'react-copy-code';

const App = () => (
   <CodeBlock>
      {write the rest of your component here}
      {using as many pre code blocks you want}
   </CodeBlock>
);
```

or

```
import CodeBlock from 'react-copy-code';

const App = () => (
   <CodeBlock innerHtml>
      {html string is passed in as the only child}
   </CodeBlock>
);
```
